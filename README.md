Updating template

* Make the changes directly to the script file so that you have the export template functional as desired, 
* Run command prompt. "mse --create-installer magic-toexp.mse-export-template". 

What it does is literally the reverse of installing the package. The installer is a form of zip, but with modifications so that it will only be properly packaged via the command line.
